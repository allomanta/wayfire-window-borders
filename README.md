# Wayfire-window-borders

This is a plugin for [Wayfire](https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire) that surrounds windows with a simple color border.
The plugin is just the decor plugin from wayfire with an override to also apply borders to windows that have opted for client side decorations and with all the other decorations stripped from it.

To install on Arch just run `makepkg --install` and otherwise you can use the build script/install using meson+ninja.
